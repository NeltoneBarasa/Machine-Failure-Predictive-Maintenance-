# Machine-Failure-Predictive-Maintenance-

The project focuses on predicting machine failures using machine learning techniques. It analyzes a dataset (`Machine failure.csv`) that contains operational data from machines, capturing key metrics related to their performance. The primary objective is to identify patterns and trends that indicate potential failures, allowing for early intervention. To achieve this, the project applies various data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables to ensure the data is ready for machine learning models.

To gain insights from the data, the project utilizes `pandas` for data manipulation and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA). This step helps identify correlations between different machine parameters and failures. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets to ensure that the model is evaluated on unseen data. One-hot encoding is applied to categorical variables, and numerical features are normalized to improve model performance.

A `RandomForestClassifier` is used as the primary machine learning model to predict machine failures. This algorithm is well-suited for handling complex relationships within the data. Model performance is assessed using key metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrices, mean absolute error (MAE), and mean squared error (MSE). These evaluations provide insights into the modelâ€™s effectiveness in distinguishing between normal and failing machine conditions.

By automating machine failure detection, the project helps industries minimize downtime, optimize maintenance schedules, and reduce operational costs. The predictive model enables companies to implement proactive maintenance strategies, reducing the risk of unexpected breakdowns. This approach improves overall equipment efficiency and reliability, contributing to a more cost-effective and data-driven industrial workflow.
